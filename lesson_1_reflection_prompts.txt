How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Changed lines were isolated and shown together for easy comparison.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Much easier to see the evolution of a project

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Manually saving forces you to take charge of the process. 
    The problem is remembering to do it and to do it consistently. 
    Google ensures that it happens whether you are paying attention or not. 
    However, there is a little bit of loss of control
    Google autosave does not necessarily save at logical points
    Manual save allows for grouping logical changes so that versions reflect them

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Since Git is designed for tracking code changes, it is designed for tracking changes to dependent code
    E.g.: .h or .css files that affect .html or .c functionality
    Google is designed as an alternative to Word, but cloud-based with an autosave feature
    It's not designed as a code version-control systm

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log shows the entire history of a project with all of its logical changes. 
    If the comments are good, it can show you a nice overview of the development of a project.
    git diff shows the specific changes between two different version commits of a project
    If the changes in a commit are targeted and succinct, it will be easy to follow the code changes between versions.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Git version control makes it very easy to try out different versions of a project.
    Changes between versions can be isolated

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Let's start using it on my files for project 1
