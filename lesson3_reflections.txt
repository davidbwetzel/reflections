When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	Mainly when you want to share your work with others. Especially useful for colaborating with people in different locations

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	It makes more sense to pull manually because others might make changes to a shared repository that you are not ready to incorporate into your local branch.
